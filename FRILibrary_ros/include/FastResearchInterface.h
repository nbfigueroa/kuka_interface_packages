//!
//! \brief
//! <b>Provides easy access to \em all functionalities of
//! Fast Research Interface of the KUKA Light-Weight Robot IV</b>
//!
//! \details
//! This is the main class of the Fast Research Interface Library for the KUKA Light-Weight Robot IV.
//! An object of this class provides the following functionalities:\n
//! <ul>
//! <li>Setting basic attributes of the interface by using the
//! initialization file of the Fast Research Interface Library (cf. \ref sec_InitFile).
//! <li>Creating a communication thread that is dedicated for all UDP communication procedures to exchange data between the
//! KRC unit and the remote host.
//! <li>Creating a timer thread that periodically send signal through a condition variable
//! <li>As soon as the communication thread cyclically receives data telegrams from the KRC unit:
//! <ul>
//! <li>Providing robot status information (e.g., temperature, arm power state, errors, warnings, etc.)
//! <li>Providing robot control data (e.g., measured joint position vector, measured joint torque vector, etc.)
//! <li>Providing shared KRL variables
//! <li>Providing communication status and quality data (e.g., jitter, latency, etc.; measured by the KRC host)
//! <li>Setting robot control data (e.g., commanded joint positions, commanded joint torques, etc.)
//! <li>Setting shared KRL variables
//! <li>Performing the start-up procedure of the robot
//! <li>Performing the shutdown procedure of the robot
//! <li>Enabling low-level real-time data logging methods
//! <li>Providing two different timer signals (KRC timer and local timer)
//! <li>A real-time capable method for console output
//! </ul>
//! </ul>
//! Users may use this class as the interface to the KRC unit if the complete functionality is required for the desired application.
//! In order to provide a simple and easy-to-start-with interface, this class is used by (but not derived to) the classes\n
//! <ul>
//! <li>LWRJointPositionController for the joint position controller,
//! <li>LWRCartImpedanceController for the Cartesian impedance controller, and
//! <li>LWRJointImpedanceController for the joint impedance controller,\n
//! </ul>
//! which are all derived from the class LWRBaseControllerInterface.
//!
//! \attention
//! Only \em one object of this class is supposed to be created on a remote host. Otherwise
//! \em indeterministic behavior may occur.
//!
//! \remark
//! For a general description of the Fast Research Interface Library, please refer to the \ref sec_Introduction.

//! Constructor
//!
//! \details
//! This constructor performs several procedures. It\n
//! <ul>
//! <li> initializes all class attributes,
//! <li> reads all parameters of the initialization file specified by \c InitFileName using the method
//! FastResearchInterface::ReadInitFile(), which further on uses an object of the class InitializationFileEntry,
//! <li> sets the priority, which is specified in the initialization file to the calling thread,
//! <li> creates the timer thread FastResearchInterface::TimerThreadMain() running at the
//! priority, which is specified in the initialization file,
//! <li> creates the communication thread FastResearchInterface::KRCCommunicationThreadMain() running at the
//! priority, which is specified in the initialization file,
//! <li> creates the Console object FastResearchInterface::OutputConsole, which provides the possibility of using
//! Console::printf() in real-time parts of the object, and
//! <li> creates the DataLogging object FastResearchInterface::DataLogger, which provides the possibility of logging
//! low-level control data under real-time conditions.\n\n\n
//!	</ul>
//! In case,
//! <ul>
//! <li> the initialization file specified by \c InitFileName cannot be opened,
//! <li> the initialization file specified by \c InitFileName does not contain all required parameters (cf. \ref sec_InitFile), or
//! <li> one of the threads FastResearchInterface::KRCCommunicationThreadMain() or FastResearchInterface::TimerThreadMain()
//! cannot be created successfully
//!	</ul>
//! the constructor lets the calling \em process terminate and exits with a value of \c EXIT_FAILURE.
//!
//! \param InitFileName
//! A pointer to an array of \c char values containing the path and filename of the
//! initialization file (e.g., <tt>\"/home/lwrcontrol/etc/980039-FRI-Driver.init\"</tt>).
//! For details about this file, please refer to \ref sec_InitFile.
//!
//! \note All threads of this class, that is,\n\n

//! <li> the output thread of the class Console, Console::ConsoleThreadMain(), and

//!
//! \brief
//! Starts the robot
//!
//! \details
//! This method performs a complete start-up procedure of the robot arm. The following steps are executed:\n\n
//! <ol>
//! <li> Before the KRL program \c FRIControl (cf.\ref sec_KRLFile1) is started by the user, the constructor
//! FastResearchInterface::FastResearchInterface::() should be called in order to prevent any loss of UDP packages.
//! <li> If the KRC unit is not already in <em>Monitor Mode</em> (i.e., no communication between the remote
//! host and the KRC unit is performed), the method waits for the call of the KRL function <tt>friOpen()</tt>
//! to receive UDP messages in order to let the KRC unit switch to <em>Monitor Mode</em>.
//! <li> Once, the KRC unit runs in <em>Monitor Mode</em>, the method sets the KRL variable <tt>$FRI_FRM_INT[16]</tt>
//! to a value of \c 10, which lets the KRL program \c FRIControl call the function <tt>friStart()</tt> in order to
//! switch from <em>Monitor Mode</em> to <em>Command Mode</em>.
//! <li> In the transition phase, the following command variables are sent from the remote host to the KRC unit
//! (see also: FastResearchInterface::SetControlScheme()):\n\n
//! <ul>
//! <li> Joint position control
//! <ul>
//! <li> Desired joint position vector = Current joint position vector
//! </ul>\n
//! <li> Cartesian impedance control
//! <ul>
//! <li> Desired Cartesian pose frame = Last commanded Cartesian pose frame
//! <li> Desired Cartesian pose offset frame = Identity frame
//! <li> Desired additional force/torque vector = Zero vector
//! <li> The desired Cartesian stiffness and damping values remain unchanged and may be specified by the user
//! by using the methods FastResearchInterface::SetCommandedCartStiffness() and
//! FastResearchInterface::SetCommandedCartDamping(), if required.
//! </ul>\n
//! <li> Joint impedance control
//! <ul>
//! <li> Desired joint position vector = Current joint position vector
//! <li> Desired joint position offset vector = Zero vector
//! <li> Desired additional joint torque vector = Zero vector
//! <li> The desired joint stiffness and damping values remain unchanged and may be specified by the user
//! by using the methods FastResearchInterface::SetCommandedJointStiffness() and
//! FastResearchInterface::SetCommandedJointDamping(), if required.
//! </ul>\n
//! <li> Joint torque control:
//! <ul>
//! <li> Desired joint torque vector = Zero vector
//! </ul>
//! </ul>\n
//! <li> After the KRC unit switched to <em>Command Mode</em>, the method waits until the robot is ready for
//! operation, that is, until the result value of FastResearchInterface::IsMachineOK() is \c true.
//! </ol>\n
//! The complete start-up procedure must not take longer than \c TimeOutValueInSeconds seconds. If completed successfully,
//! the robot arm is ready for operation. This method should be used pairwise with the method
//! FastResearchInterface::StopRobot() in order to ensure a safe and error-free operation.
//!
//! \param ControlMode
//! Either value of the enumeration FastResearchInterface::LWRControlModes:\n
//! <ul>
//! <li> FastResearchInterface::JOINT_POSITION_CONTROL for joint position control
//! <li> FastResearchInterface::CART_IMPEDANCE_CONTROL for Cartesian impedance control
//! <li> FastResearchInterface::JOINT_IMPEDANCE_CONTROL	for joint impedance control\n
//! </ul>
//! If this method is called by an object derived from the class LWRBaseControllerInterface, this parameter is
//! automatically set by their respective method for starting the robot.\n\n
//!
//! \param TimeOutValueInSeconds
//! Timeout value in seconds for the user to turn on the robot arm by using the KUKA Control Panel.
//! The default value of this optional parameter is 120 seconds.
//!
//! \return
//! <ul>

//! FastResearchInterface::IsMachineOK() is \c false), call FastResearchInterface::StopRobot() first. It might be
